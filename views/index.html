            Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a
            founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark
            Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
            as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his
            great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of
            the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents
            and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was
            kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a
            fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created
            an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning
            home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as
            well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight
            against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.
