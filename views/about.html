            Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found
            himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all
            while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his
            legacy. After the Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to
            serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to
            upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with Pepper
            Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the
            Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the battle,
            he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to
            create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and help him retire.
            The 2012 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of
            retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved
            ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was
            destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as
            the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian,
            and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate
            Protocol after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were
            officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more
            armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture
            of Baron Strucker and acquiring Loki's Scepter. Once the threat of
            HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Scarlet Witch's
            visions, built Ultron with the help of Bruce Banner as a new
            peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to
            retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world
            and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity.
            Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not
            without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which
            Sokovia was elevated into the sky. After the Ultron Offensive, Stark
            retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the
            A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much
            destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support
            the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally
            Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter
            Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The end result left the
            Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the
            Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark
            returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a
            better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in
            the process.
